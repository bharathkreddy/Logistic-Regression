# Week 6 LOGISTIC REGRESSION - THEORY

[This notebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/Logistic-Regression/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Theory.ipynb) is a step-by-step intro to get an intution around Logistic Regression and steps to build a logistic regression model. I explain the below concept using data on money spent on advertising on 3 channels - TV, Radio and Newspaper and use these to predict sales of a product.
 1. What are classification problems
 2. Why do we need Logistic Regression and problems with using Linear Regression for clasffication problems
 3. Use pipelines to tranform the data
 4. Logisitic Regression Theory
 5. Building a model and predicting using Logistic Regression
 6. Measuring how good our model predictions are using confusion matrix, 
 7. Understanding of confusion matrix and dervie stats like Accuracy, Precision and Recall.
 
 ## Dataset Details
 The dataset is available [here](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/Logistic-Regression/blob/master/Data/Default.xlsx). This dataset give data on 
 1. Predicted = Default ( a marker on a default or not-default)
 2. Predictors 3 variables
  1.If the person was a student or not
  2.Balance - amount of payment outstanding
  3. Income - income for the person.
  
We use there three predictors to preding the chance of a person defaulting
